This is a simple (and somewhat sloppy) project designed to showcase the behavior of the planets in the solar system when we adopt various planets as stationary frames of reference. It was inspired by the medieval preoccupation with geoheliocentrism: I found it charming to instead ask "What does the solar system look like if we make the planets orbit around Mars?" and of course that question generalizes readily to other planets in the solar system.
